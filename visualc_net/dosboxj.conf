#        fullscreen: Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
#        fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
#    fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                      Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                      If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#                      On Windows 10 with display scaling (Scale and layout) set to a value above 100%, it is recommended
#                      to use a lower full/windowresolution, in order to avoid window size problems.
#  windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                      (output=surface does not!)
#    windowposition: Set the window position at startup in the positionX,positionY format (e.g.: 1300,200).
#                      The window will be centered with "," (or empty), and will be in the original position with "-".
#            output: What video system to use for output.
#                      Possible values: surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb.

#       sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#       waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#          priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                      pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                      Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#        mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
